- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alejandro Mallo.
- ğŸ‘€ I am interested in finding my way to become a full-fledged software developer, not just another "junior" programmer. (and Climbing! ğŸ§— 6C+).
- ğŸŒ± I am learning everything I should have known years ago. I started working as a full stack web developer in 2008. I am currently relearning everything from the basics.
- ğŸ“« I'm not on Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn.
